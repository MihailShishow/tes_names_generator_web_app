# Names Generator

This application was initially designed as an attempt to create a tool for names generation for The Elder Scrolls games universe.

> In the future, more settings and universes may be added.

By using slightly modified code from [here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Markov_chains_name_generator_in_Python), this application helps to generate names for the characters of all of the playable races from The Elder Scrolls games, starting from the third chapter.

Base data was taken from the [the UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Names), then normalized and processed to generate new names.
